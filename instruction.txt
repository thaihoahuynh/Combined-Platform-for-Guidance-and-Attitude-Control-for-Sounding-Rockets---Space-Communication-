# INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPLITTING INTO FILES

TO USE THIS CODE:

1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Copy this entire file
3. Split it into separate files by copying each section:
   - Everything under "FILE 1: config.py" → save as config.py
   - Everything under "FILE 2: atmosphere.py" → save as atmosphere.py
   - Everything under "FILE 3: aerodynamics.py" → save as aerodynamics.py
   - Everything under "FILE 4: controllers.py" → save as controllers.py
   
4. The other files (trajectory.py, rocket_dynamics.py, plotting.py, main.py)
   are already in the artifacts shown above.

5. Make sure you have ALL 9 files:
   ✓ config.py
   ✓ atmosphere.py
   ✓ aerodynamics.py
   ✓ controllers.py
   ✓ trajectory.py
   ✓ rocket_dynamics.py
   ✓ plotting.py
   ✓ main.py
   ✓ requirements.txt

6. Then run: pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Then run: python main.py
